Description:
This mushroom simulator will simulate several varieties of mushrooms and their growing conditions. Inspired by games like Dwarf Fortress and their 
complex simulations of worlds, this game will try and simulate the various things that are involved in the growing of mushrooms, like nearby trees and features,
rain, the seasons, and so on. 

Needed Objects:

Trees: There should be a virtual tree class with a variety of instantiations. Each tree should 
be either coniferous or deciduous, and have a type/species (I.E, oak, douglas fir, etc). Information
such as the height of the tree should also be included, as well as the age of the tree, the extent of its root structures, etc.

Mushrooms: Mushrooms grow from mycelium. Each block around a tree can contain mycelium, and that block will either be growing mushrooms or not based of 
the mushrooms requirements. Mycelium should grow to adjacent blocks depending on what is in the block. Mushrooms should also grow at different times of the year,
depending on soil moisture.

Soil: Mushrooms and trees grow in soil. Each block should have soil with its own traits. Each block of soil could have different consistency? Different kinds of soil?
Probably after the basics are already completed. At the very least, soil should have a moisture level depending on rain.

Other things to include:

Seasons. Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring. Should change every 30 days or so. Perhaps, variable number of days per season?

Rain. Should happen depending on season, etc. Maybe cloud cover could be included to help determine likelyhood of rain.

Temperature. Should also depend on season, maybe affects likelihood of rain.
